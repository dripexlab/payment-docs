# Connecting Payfast


This guide outlines how to connect your custom Payfast payment integration in Dripcel.

1. Click on **Payment Integrations** in the main menu.
2. Find **Payfast** in the list and click **Connect**.

- Retrieve your Merchant ID and Key after verification

4. In the **Sandbox** section, enter your **Merchant ID** and **Merchant Key**.
5. Create and confirm a **SALT passphrase** via **Edit Passphrase**.

You may use test credentials for both Live and Test sections to simulate setup.

6. Click **Connect** and wait for the **Settings updated** popup.
7. Return to the main screen. Look for green check marks indicating both modes are active.
8. Click **Set as default** to finalize setup.
